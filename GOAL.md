Problem Description:

There is a disk with a set of photos. At some point, the space on this disk runs out, prompting the purchase of a new, larger disk. A copy of the old disk is then made onto the new one, and new photos are stored on the new disk. This process of copying photos is repeated several times, resulting in multiple copies of the photos. Additionally, some hard drives fail, leading to errors that corrupt certain photos. Managing all these disks and photos becomes necessary.

Tasks:

 - Build a global index of all photos without the ability to connect all disks simultaneously.
 - Add meta-information to files, such as checksums.
